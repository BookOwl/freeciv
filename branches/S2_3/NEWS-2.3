========================
Welcome to Freeciv 2.3.2
========================

The changes in the 2.3.x series are summarised below.
For changes prior to 2.3, see NEWS. For more detailed changes,
see the ChangeLog file.


CHANGES FROM 2.3.1 to 2.3.2
---------------------------

   (from <http://freeciv.wikia.com/wiki/NEWS-2.3.2>)

Server / General

     * Bug fix: the city bribe cost could be negative (i.e., you would be
       paid for inciting a city!) -- this was particularly common with the
       'multiplayer' ruleset. This fix may also cause previously positive
       city bribe costs to increase. GNA#19272
     * Bug fix: in a game with many players (such as the current maximum
       of 126), the server could crash when the game ended. (To see an
       accurate endgame report in this situation, both client and server
       must be upgraded.) GNA#19241
     * Bug fix: for games with more than 40 players (or, in rare cases,
       fewer), information about the parts of the map known to some
       players was saved in the savefile in a platform-dependent way. This
       could in principle lead to information loss on some platforms, or
       savefiles created on one platform not loading correctly on another,
       although on tested platforms (Linux x86_64, Solaris) the
       information was merely disarranged in a compatible way, causing no
       observable failure.
       From 2.3.2, the server will save this information in a
       platform-independent way, although it will attempt to recover
       information from old savegames. GNA#19029
     * Bug fix: upon learning a new tech that replaced a unit with a more
       expensive one, obsolete units being built in cities at the time
       could disappear entirely from the city worklists (rather than being
       replaced by another unit). GNA#18736
     * Allow the '/remove' server command to be issued after the game has
       started. GNA#18641 GNA#18776
     * Bug fix: in a deep fiscal crisis requiring forced selling of
       multiple buildings, insufficient buildings could be sold, leading
       to a negative gold balance. GNA#19494
     * Bug fix: quell error messages when a unit changed owners in the
       middle of working on an improvement such as Railroad, when the new
       owner did not possess the requisite technology. GNA#16429
     * Bug fix: assertion failures associated with many auto-settlers
       trying to work on the same project. GNA#19512
     * Bug fix: assertion failures on loading non-standard rulesets which
       use a Max_Rates effect with a Tech requirement. GNA#19450
     * Bug fix: possible server crash in rulesets with barbarian nations
       with only a single leader defined. GNA#19554
     * Bug fix: '/reset game' may have restored the wrong setting values
       on some platforms. GNA#19345
     * Bug fix: the trading_tech/gold/city settings did not appear in any
       of the server setting categories. GNA#19346
     * Fix the authentication database setup script, setup_auth_server.sh,
       to allow space for IPv6 addresses. (Existing databases would have
       to be upgraded manually to fix this issue.) GNA#19485
     * The embedded Lua scripting engine has been updated to version
       5.1.5. GNAPATCH#3166
     * Robustness improvements in the face of malformed files. GNA#19348
       GNA#19446
     * Various internal changes which should only affect developers.
       GNA#19015 GNA#19170 GNA#19228 GNA#19297 GNA#19349 GNA#19389
       GNA#19398 GNA#19539

Clients

     * Add a confirmation popup when disbanding units. GNA#19459
     * Bug fix: the client could crash immediately after connecting in
       some circumstances with some non-standard rulesets (notably, for
       players with A. Smith's Trading Co in the Longturn LTeX23 ruleset).
       GNA#19219
     * Bug fix: the "in progress" unit counts in the units report did not
       take account of multiple city build slots, for instance in the
       'experimental' ruleset. GNA#19339
     * Bug fix: the total unit upkeep in the unit report could get out of
       date when changing a unit's home city while the report was open.
       GNA#19405
     * (Gtk) All diplomatic meeting popups now open in a single tab, to
       improve usability in games with many players. GNA#18835
     * (Gtk) Fix a minor scrollbar display glitch with some system themes.
       GNA#18607
     * (SDL) Several UI bug fixes:
          + In the units report, "under construction", "soonest
            completion", and "totals" displayed no information. GNA#19403
          + It was impossible for diplomatic units to establish an embassy
            in a city; attempting to do so caused the city to be
            investigated. GNA#19246
          + Nothing happened when a Spy was ordered to steal a random
            technology. GNA#19246
          + When a Spy was given a choice of building to sabotage, many
            options were omitted. GNA#19288
          + In the foreign intelligence report, the nation flag could hide
            information about the nation's technologies. GNA#19290
          + Nation selection dialog:
               o Only the first 256 of the available nations could be
                 selected (up to the Omanis). GNA#19065
               o The next/previous buttons for leader selection did not
                 redraw properly. GNA#19068
          + Minor bugs with password entry to an authenticated server.
            GNA#19259
     * (Xaw) Fix an assertion failure when the game ends. GNA#19399

Tilesets / Art

     * Bug fix: in the Amplio2 tileset, when not using the city bar,
       resize the "city occupied" graphic to match the flag size.
       GNAPATCH#2525

Gameplay / Rules

     * As a side effect of the fix for GNA#18736, if a unit is bought in a
       city in the same turn as it is made obsolete by an advance, you
       always get the obsolete unit rather than an upgraded version
       (regardless of the relative costs of the units).
     * Bug fix: in custom rulesets, it was not usefully possible to make a
       technology unreachable by giving it a root_req of itself (this
       should make it reachable only by national init_techs or by
       scripting); such technologies could not be used at all. GNA#18394
     * In custom rulesets, the Unit_Recover effect can now apply to
       specific unit types and units; previously, it could only take
       effect on a per-player basis. GNA#19467

AI

     * Improvements to AI diplomat behaviour:
          + The AI's diplomats were not dodging enemy units when
            travelling from place to place. GNA#19014
          + The AI could stack many diplomats next to an enemy city when
            they had nothing to do. Now it sends them to different cities.
            GNAPATCH#2978
     * The AI could mistakenly consider the effect of Barracks and Sun
       Tzu's War Academy on unit veteran levels to be cumulative.
       GNA#19447 GNA#19466

Help / Documentation

     * Improve Unix man pages. GNA#19167 GNA#19173
     * Other minor improvements to documentation and in-game text.
       GNA#17776 GNA#19383 GNAPATCH#3119 GNAPATCH#3148

Translations

     * Updated translations:
          + Complete translations: British English, Catalan, French,
            Japanese, Polish, Scots Gaelic, Spanish.
          + Incomplete translations: Finnish (98.6%).

Build/portability

     * Fix compilation with newer versions of zlib. GNA#19501
     * Fix failure to compile with compression disabled at build time.
       GNA#19347
     * Change configure script handling of compiler flags, fixing some
       warnings about compiler flags when building with clang. (Note that
       Freeciv is known not to build cleanly with clang yet.) GNA#19008
     * Use Lua include path set by configure script, to assist packagers.
       GNA#19397
     * Running autogen.sh from a release tarball failed due to looking for
       an absent file. GNA#19456
     * Update Gtk client dependency documentation. GNAPATCH#3109


CHANGES FROM 2.3.0 to 2.3.1
---------------------------

   (from <http://freeciv.wikia.com/wiki/NEWS-2.3.1>)

Server / General

     * Bug fix: when loading pre-2.3 savegames (including the supplied
       tutorial scenario), the server setting "onsetbarbs" was
       accidentally reset to 0, causing immediate barbarian uprisings
       which would tend to wipe out players before they could get
       established. (The default behaviour, which has been restored, is
       for barbarians and pirates not to appear for sixty turns.)
       GNA#18472
     * Bug fix: the server could crash when units were set to
       auto-explore. GNA#18796
     * Bug fix: the server could crash when starting the game on a map
       without special resources. GNA#18533
     * Fix a server crash associated with ocean cities; this showed up
       with the Alien World modpack. GNA#18557
     * Bug fix: games started with identical parameters including random
       seeds could allocate start positions in varying orders. GNA#13679
     * Bug fix: turn timeouts greater than about 60 hours were not being
       displayed correctly in the client, although they took effect
       correctly on the server. Both client and server must be upgraded
       for this fix to be effective. GNA#18687 GNA#19004
     * Prevent starting games with map areas greater than the maximum
       supported (128,000 tiles) -- this was causing trouble when such
       games were saved. GNA#18537
     * Prevent generation of maps with odd ysize with iso/hex topology --
       this was causing assertion failures while the game was running.
       GNA#18875
     * Bug fix: if /remove was used, the server could crash on saving/or
       loading a game, and some players' explored territory could be
       forgotten. GNA#19007
     * Bug fix: bases were not being saved or loaded with playerless
       scenarios. GNA#18930
     * Bug fix: a scenario saved after the start of a game could have an
       invalid format. GNA#18652
     * Bug fix: if a game saved after a player had been removed was
       reloaded, the order in which players' turns took effect could be
       incorrect for that turn. GNA#18886
     * Robustness fixes when loading invalidly formatted savegames.
       GNA#18546
     * Make Freeciv generally more tolerant of Unix/DOS line ending
       differences in rulesets, save files, etc. GNAPATCH#2843 GNA#18434
     * Fix assertion failures when server LAN announcements were disabled
       with "-A none". GNA#18511
     * Bug fix: misplaced '/' in unknown command response from server to
       client. GNA#18678
     * Allow server settings to be specified in rulesets with similar
       syntax to the server command line. GNA#18328
     * Improvements to the checks made when a ruleset is loaded. GNA#18514
       GNAPATCH#2925
     * Bug fix: units on sentry duty could sometimes fail to wake up when
       an enemy unit moved into a neighbouring city. GNA#18388
     * Bug fix: remove lingering effects from bases when a city replaced
       them on the same tile GNA#18529 or when the underlying terrain was
       transformed GNA#18513.
     * Bug fix: move/disband units on a tile when their native base is
       pillaged, and they have no other means to remain in that tile.
       GNA#18528
     * Bug fix: disband boats when surrounding terrain changes would leave
       them trapped in a landlocked city. GNA#18613
     * Bug fix: don't allow a unit to move from a transporter into a city
       where it should not be able to exist. GNA#18675
     * Fix various inconsistencies with when the roads built in to a city
       were and weren't removed from a tile. GNA#18553
     * Limit the maximum amount of calculation the citizen governor will
       do for a city. This could cause the server to spend many minutes
       between turns, particularly with large city radii, for instance
       when auto-arranging citizens after city growth. This is only a
       partial solution; in this situation, the governor will not make an
       optimal decision. GNA#18407
     * Cosmetic improvements to the freeciv-modpack utility:
          + Add icons on platforms other than Windows, and .desktop files
            for Unix desktop environments. GNAPATCH#2810 GNAPATCH#2948
            GNAPATCH#2928
          + Add a window title. GNA#18589
          + Add --help/--version command-line options. GNAPATCH#2808
          + Add a man page. GNAPATCH#2890 GNAPATCH#2928
     * Various internal changes which should only affect developers.
       GNA#18491 GNA#18464 GNA#18418 GNA#17846

Clients

     * Changes to science dialog:
          + The "turns/advance" display is based on the total number of
            bulbs for the current advance, as in 2.2.x, rather than the
            number of bulbs remaining. GNA#18499
          + When calculating the number of bulbs required before the
            long-term goal will be complete, discount progress already
            made on the current advance, if it is a prerequisite of the
            goal. GNA#18547
     * Add an option controlling combat animation speed. GNA#18770
     * Bug fix: in rulesets containing immobile units, the client could
       crash if an attempt was made to give such a unit a go-to order.
       GNA#19001
     * (Gtk) Bug fix: clicking Previous/Next City buttons as a player
       observer could cause a crash. GNA#18608
     * (Gtk) Bug fix: crash when started with no usable theme. GNA#18952
     * (Gtk) Bug fix: the text cursor misbehaved when changing the
       Scenario Description in the editor. GNA#18536
     * (Gtk) Bug fix: keyboard shortcuts for buttons in the Messages
       dialog clashed, rendering them non-functional. GNA#18500
     * (Gtk) Bug fix: on Windows, reordering items in the worklist by
       dragging should work again. (This is actually a function of the Gtk
       version, so the issue may still be seen on other platforms.)
       GNA#18517
     * (Gtk) Workaround to make various menu bars (including ones
       essential for diplomacy) not disappear when using Ubuntu's Unity
       window manager. (This workaround has been included in standard
       Ubuntu packages since 2.2.7.) GNA#18260
     * (Gtk) Remove various 'Address' fields from the editor in non-debug
       builds, as they are only of interest to developers. GNA#18584
     * (Xaw) Rewritten connection dialog, restoring metaserver and
       authentication support. GNAPATCH#2813
     * (Xaw) Bug fix: the unit count in the city report was incorrect.
       GNA#18486

Tilesets / Art

     * Bug fix: the hex2t tileset would not load due to a spurious
       dependency on the removed amplio tileset. GNA#18458
     * Bug fix: tiny glitch in one of the Amplio/Amplio2 city graphics.
       GNA#18935

Gameplay / Rules

Supplied rulesets

     * Multiplayer ruleset: fix a script error when researching future
       tech. GNA#18710
     * Changes to the experimental ruleset:
          + Rule changes to make the effects of plague more bearable in
            the early game GNA#18535, GNAPATCH#2998:
               o Aqueducts now reduce illness by a further 20% until
                 Industrialization is researched.
               o Temples now reduce illness by 20%.
          + Triremes no longer move at triple speed along rivers.
            GNA#18590
     * Updated earth-160x90-v2 scenario with more start positions and a
       few terrain tweaks. GNAPATCH#2949

AI

     * Autosettlers were miscalculating the worth of tiles with resources,
       leading to them not working valuable resources. GNAPATCH#2840
     * Autosettlers never considered improving city centre tiles.
       GNA#17767, GNAPATCH#2866, GNA#18549, GNAPATCH#2957

Help / Documentation

     * Add Freeciv client version and name to built-in help. GNA#18198
     * Bug fix: the "Strategy and Tactics" help menu item was broken in
       some locales. GNA#18425
     * Other minor improvements to documentation. GNA#18512 GNA#18552
       GNA#18424 GNA#18677 GNA#18897 GNA#18920
     * Invisible changes to assist with translation. GNA#18451 GNA#18934

Translations

     * Updated translations:
          + Complete translations: British English, Catalan, French,
            Polish, Spanish, Scots Gaelic.
          + Incomplete translations: Finnish (95.4%), Ukrainian (82%).
     * Many typo fixes in English strings. GNA#18416
     * The Windows installer now lets you choose the interface language at
       installation time (so you don't have to set it by hand). GNA#19019

Build/portability

     * Fixes for portability to OpenBSD on sparc64 (and probably other
       platforms):
          + Fix crash on launching server. GNA#18482
          + Fix network header inclusion order. GNA#18468 GNA#18501
     * Compilation fix for platforms where AI_NUMERICSERV is not defined
       (such as Mac OS X 10.5). GNA#18871
     * Compilation fix for platforms which define min() and max().
       GNA#18963
     * Remove spurious requirement for C++ compiler. GNA#17488
     * Add a configure option --with-mysql-libdir. GNAPATCH#2867


CHANGES FROM 2.3.0-RC2 to 2.3.0
-------------------------------

   For those who've been trying the betas, the changes since the final
   Release Candidate (2.3.0-RC2) are very minor:
     * Completed translation for Scottish Gaelic.
     * Updated translations for Catalan, Ukrainian, Polish, and French.


CHANGES FROM 2.3.0-RC1 to 2.3.0-RC2
-----------------------------------

   (from <http://freeciv.wikia.com/wiki/NEWS-2.3.0-RC2>)

     * Fix an issue where a client couldn't find the server to launch it;
       the client now looks in the directory it was installed into.
       GNA#18406
     * For security reasons, in non-debug builds, the client no longer
       searches for a server to launch in directories relative to the
       current working directory. GNAPATCH#2827
     * Some fixes which may improve the reliability of the modpack
       installer. GNA#18354, GNAPATCH#2812
     * The civ2 ruleset now uses a restricted set of 25 nations, to better
       resemble the original rules. Loading civ2 savegames from older
       versions of Freeciv may cause nations to be reassigned; it will not
       be possible to load a civ2 savegame with more than 23
       (non-barbarian) players. GNA#18419
     * In the Windows builds, a packaging issue prevented most of the
       on-line help from being localized, and caused it to be badly
       formatted in English. GNA#18396
     * A couple of strings in the research report were not marked for
       localization. GNA#18433
     * Some server settings' parameters were not being localized in the
       Gtk client. GNA#18396
     * Fixed corrupted display with many tilesets in the Xaw client.
       GNA#18376
     * 2.3.0-RC1 was erroneously built as a beta release. GNAPATCH#2828
     * Typo fixes in developer documentation. GNA#18334
     * New Scottish Gaelic localization (not yet complete). GNAPATCH#2814
     * Updates to Spanish, Polish, Catalan, French, and British English
       translations.


CHANGES FROM 2.3.0-beta4 to 2.3.0-RC1
-------------------------------------

   (from <http://freeciv.wikia.com/wiki/NEWS-2.3.0-RC1>)

Server / General

     * Bug fix: server crash and assertion failure associated with civil
       war. GNA#17439
     * Bug fix: clients were not always updated when a city was lost (for
       instance, due to civil war):
          + The loser's client, and anyone who shared their vision, could
            still show the city as owned by the losing player, leading to
            client crashes. GNA#17990 GNA#17860
          + The loser's client could still show units in the city as owned
            by that player. GNA#18194
     * Bug fix: the server's stack could overflow (causing a crash) with
       large maps, particularly on Windows (where the trouble was observed
       around 80,000 tiles). GNA#17962
     * Bug fix: the server could crash with rulesets where
       gold_upkeep_style=2 due to ending up with a negative gold balance.
       Previously, if there was not enough gold, at most one unit and one
       building would be sold per turn. Now, as many units/buildings are
       sold alternately as necessary to restore a positive balance. (This
       doesn't affect the supplied rulesets.) GNA#18221
     * Bug fix: pillaging a road (or removing it in the editor) under a
       road-native unit (such as a Big Land unit in the experimental
       ruleset) could cause a server crash. GNA#16281
     * Bug fix (Windows binaries only): the modpack installer,
       freeciv-modpack.exe, was completely non-functional on Windows; it
       crashed immediately on launching. It can now download files.
       GNA#18354 GNAPATCH#2812
     * Fix a warning loading some old savegames. GNA#18209
     * Suppress a recently-introduced assertion failure that could show up
       in some circumstances. GNA#18095
     * Changes to the 'timeout' setting now always have immediate effect,
       as in 2.0.x; previously, changes between non-zero values would not
       take effect until the next turn. GNA#18079
     * Allow the 'unitwaittime' option to be used when 'timeout' is 0
       (disabled). GNA#17975
     * When global warming or nuclear winter occur, changes between land
       and water are now restricted to coastlines. Also, city tiles are no
       longer protected from climate change in certain circumstances.
       GNA#17953
     * Bug fix: inaccurate message when trying to accept an alliance pact
       which is invalid due to the other party's war. GNA#18066
     * Bug fix: it was impossible for existing users to log in to servers
       with authentication enabled running on big-endian machines (such as
       sparc64). GNA#18170
     * Bug fix: more accurate reporting of network errors on Windows.
       GNA#18210
     * Bug fix: freeciv-modpack didn't always find the user's home
       directory correctly (notably on Windows). GNA#18262
     * Change path handling to allow scenarios to be downloaded with
       freeciv-modpack. GNAPATCH#2500
     * Clean up handling of changing default metaserver URL between
       versions. GNAPATCH#2764
     * Fix path handling of the ser and civ scripts to be consistent with
       the behaviour of the unwrapped binaries. GNA#17461
     * Apply latest lua-5.1.4 patch (9).
     * Fix a minor server memory leak. GNAPATCH#2540
     * Various internal changes which should only affect developers.
       GNAPATCH#2630 GNA#18091 GNA#17757 GNA#16457 GNAPATCH#2736
       GNAPATCH#2772

Clients

     * Bug fix: the client could make invalid accesses with rulesets with
       variable city radii (such as the experimental ruleset). GNA#17710
     * Bug fix: the client could potentially behave as though it had made
       a successful connection to a server when in fact the connection had
       failed. GNA#18211
     * Bug fix: the client could use invalid information about the
       relationship between cities and tiles leading to an assertion
       failure. GNA#18005
     * (Gtk) Bug fix: cancelling the "build city" name dialog by pressing
       Escape could make it impossible to issue the build order again for
       some units. GNA#18163
     * (Gtk) Allocate less space to the minimap when the "Arrange widgets
       for small displays" option is enabled, since this area had grown
       since 2.2.x. GNA#17802
     * (Gtk) Bug fix: scrolling the minimap could cause confusion /
       corruption with large maps. GNA#17825
     * (Gtk) Bug fix: when the minimap is detached from the main window,
       allow it to fill its window vertically as well as horizontally.
       GNA#18180
     * (Gtk) The "Build Fortress" and "Build Airbase" entries on the
       Combat menu did not necessarily build the named bases (depending on
       the unit/ruleset). Renamed to "Build Type A/B Base". GNA#16566
     * (Gtk) Bug fix: reinstate the Shift+Ctrl+R shortcut to start a
       revolution. GNA#18296
     * (Gtk) Do not display hotkeys twice in some menu entries. GNA#17954
     * (Gtk) Allow shift-right-click-drag to add units/cities to an
       existing selection. GNA#18301
     * (Gtk) Left-click on the overview map now selects a new unit, and
       shift-left-click adds a unit to the existing selection, as on the
       main map. Previously, the overview map controls were swapped.
       GNA#18300
     * The "Sell Obsolete" button in the Economy report could never be
       pressed. It has been renamed to "Sell Redundant", and now lets
       'redundant' buildings be sold en masse (redundant buildings are
       those whose effects are entirely superseded by another, for which
       you may still be paying upkeep -- for instance, Power Plants are
       redundant in cities with a Hydro/Nuclear/Solar Plants). In the Gtk
       client, the "Obsolete" column in the Economy report has been
       replaced with a "Redundant" column showing how many of each
       building in your empire are redundant. GNA#17937
     * Bug fix: the city dialog Happiness popup text could incorrectly
       indicate a penalty when there was none in the ruleset. GNA#18150
     * Break long lines in the city dialog Happiness popup, to avoid long
       lists of buildings/wonders going off the screen. GNAPATCH#2688

Tilesets / Art

     * Fix unit upkeep icons in supplied tilesets so they don't overlap
       with each other (for instance, gold upkeep in the experimental
       ruleset). GNA#17906
     * Minor glitch fixes for Amplio2 tileset (mainly in city map).
       GNA#17998
     * freeciv-modpack.exe on Windows now has an icon. GNAPATCH#2787

Gameplay / Rules

Supplied rulesets

     * In the civ2 and multiplayer rulesets, Fundamentalism now has a
       happiness penalty for empire size (as it did in 2.0.x). GNA#18133
     * Rearrange implementation of the Hanging Gardens wonder so that it
       is not mentioned twice in the city dialog happiness popup.
       GNA#16471
     * Minor changes to nations. GNA#18182 GNAPATCH#2710

Help / Documentation

     * Fix misleading autogenerated help about the requirements for city
       celebration and rapture. GNA#17949
     * Help now documents that non-military units can enter foreign
       territory regardless of peace treaties, and don't prevent enemy
       cities from working tiles. GNA#17378
     * Refreshed and expanded the Controls section of the help.
       GNAPATCH#2648
     * Other minor improvements to in-game text. GNA#17858 GNA#17976
       GNAPATCH#2526 GNA#18207 GNAPATCH#2524 GNA#18276 GNA#18281
     * Fix some inaccuracies in README files. GNAPATCH#2431 GNAPATCH#2695
       GNAPATCH#2696 GNAPATCH#2698 GNAPATCH#2697 GNAPATCH#2768
     * Several invisible changes to assist with translation. GNA#17928
       GNAPATCH#2619 GNA#18031 GNAPATCH#2744 GNA#17137

Translations

     * Updated translations:
          + Complete translations: French, Polish.
          + Incomplete translations: Spanish (99.8%), Catalan (99.5%),
            Finnish (85%), Ukrainian (77%), Japanese (70%), Simplified
            Chinese (40%).

Build/portability

     * Fix/suppress some build-time warnings from GCC 4.6. GNA#18219
       GNA#18217
     * Fix a build-time warning when NLS is disabled. GNA#18237
     * Fix a built-time warning when building with NDEBUG. GNA#18264
     * Allow freeciv-modpack to be built without Gtk client. GNAPATCH#2712
     * Use Lua path set by configure script, to assist packagers.
       GNA#18263
     * Changes reflecting the fact that the --enable-client=gtk option to
       configure will become ambiguous in a future release. GNAPATCH#2725
       GNAPATCH#2786
     * IPv6-enabled builds no longer rely on the deprecated function
       gethostbyname2(), which may enable building on a wider variety of
       platforms. GNA#16623
     * Portability fixes. GNA#16457 GNA#18329
     * The example Debian packaging arrangements now include
       freeciv-modpack. GNAPATCH#2796


CHANGES FROM 2.3.0-beta3 to 2.3.0-beta4
---------------------------------------

   (from <http://freeciv.wikia.com/wiki/NEWS-2.3.0-beta4>)

Server / General

     * Fix server crash when an AI-controlled missile failed to eliminate
       its target. GNA#16451
     * Fix server crash with invalid arguments to "/show" command.
       GNA#17672 GNA#17765
     * Fix some server memory leaks. GNA#17667 GNA#17698 GNA#17700
       GNAPATCH#2543
     * Fix assertion failures when loading savegames. GNA#17669 GNA#17699
     * Avoid a spurious warning when loading a savegame of a ruleset with
       locked options (such as the experimental ruleset). GNA#17684
     * Track and display how a given server setting was set. GNA#17692
       GNA#17693
     * When a scenario game specifies start positions, prevent
       'maxplayers' exceeding the number of start positions (previously,
       extra players were allowed to connect in pregame, but some would be
       disconnected on game start). GNAPATCH#2577
     * When an airlift can't be completed, the server now issues an
       explanatory message. (This can happen if airlifting with allied
       cities is enabled with the 'airliftingstyle' server option.)
       GNA#17848
     * Fix configure/build problems, notably with OpenBSD. GNA#17782
     * Windows: scenarios are now sought in "~/.freeciv/scenarios" rather
       than "~/.freeciv/scenario", for consistency with other platforms.
       GNA#17787
     * Windows: scenarios are now saved in "scenarios" folder rather than
       working directory. GNA#17789
     * Stability improvements. GNA#17670 GNAPATCH#2541
     * Various internal changes which should only affect developers.
       GNA#15518 GNA#17677 GNAPATCH#2523 GNA#17744 GNA#2576 GNAPATCH#2581
       GNAPATCH#2582 GNA#17853 GNA#17811 GNA#17812 GNAPATCH#2570

Clients

     * Add a Nation column to the city report, for use by global
       observers. GNAPATCH#2571
     * Bug fix: no options for client-spawned servers were being saved.
       GNA#17751
     * Bug fix: when the metaserver does not know the number of human
       players, the client now displays "Unknown" instead of "-1".
       GNA#17708 GNA#17847
     * (Gtk) In the Goto/Airlift dialog, airport capacity information
       reinstated (it had been removed relative to 2.2.x) and expanded.
       GNAPATCH#2588 GNAPATCH#2589
     * (Gtk) Allow type-to-search when picking a nation. GNAPATCH#2459
     * (Gtk) Mark redundant/useless buildings with [DEL: strikethrough
       :DEL] markup in more places in the city dialog. GNA#17730
     * (Gtk) Bug fix: Gtk error (and possible crash) with "Arrange widgets
       for small displays" enabled. GNA#17608
     * (Gtk) Bug fix: the 'Sell All' and 'Disband' buttons on the Economy
       report did not work. GNA#17936
     * (Gtk) Bug fix: Gtk warnings with certain combo boxes. GNAPATCH#2556
       GNAPATCH#2569 GNA#17917 GNA#17872
     * (Gtk) Bug fix: speed up minimap scrolling in some circumstances
       (particularly with large maps). GNA#17878
     * (SDL) Avoid a crash when an attempt is made to use a missing sprite
       (this can happen with the experimental ruleset). GNA#17146
     * (SDL) Large tileset flags could obscure relationships in the
       nations report. GNA#17766
     * (Xaw) Airlifts involving allied cities are now possible (if enabled
       with the 'airliftingstyle' server option). GNA#15462
     * Stability improvement. GNA#17663
     * Fix some memory leaks. GNA#16639 GNA#17716 GNA#17719 GNA#17718
       GNAPATCH#2489

Tilesets / Art

     * Improvements to Amplio2 tileset:
          + New Fortress and Ruins graphics. GNAPATCH#2583
          + Use larger flags. GNAPATCH#2491
          + Minor cosmetic improvements. GNAPATCH#2584 GNAPATCH#2586
            GNAPATCH#2587
     * Added "Electric Age" city graphics to the Trident-based rulesets.
       GNAPATCH#2444
     * Iraqi flag updated, and more accurate colours in various Arab
       nation flags. GNAPATCH#2492
     * Allow more match_with entries in tilesets. This should allow the
       third-party Freeland 3 tileset to work without a patch. GNA#17095

Gameplay / Rules

Supplied rulesets

     * Multiplayer ruleset:
          + Sun Tzu's War Academy's effect on veterancy from combat was
            only applying to units defending in cities, due to technical
            limitations. This effect has been removed entirely. GNA#17332
          + The Apollo Program is once again a "small wonder" (i.e., it
            must be built by each player before they can build spaceship
            parts). GNA#17771
          + Bring the implementation of Fundamentalism into line with that
            in the "civ2" ruleset. GNA#17337
     * Experimental ruleset: more consistency in which units require gold
       upkeep after discovery of Corporation (now Musketeers don't,
       Riflemen and Cavalry do). GNA#17726
     * Fix a few broken civil war nations. GNA#17772
     * Increase limit on players for europe-200x100 scenario to match
       number of start positions (37). GNAPATCH#2580

Other rulesets

     * Buildings which enable certain units are no longer considered
       "redundant" in various situations. GNA#17731

AI

     * If the server setting 'citymindist' was changed from its default,
       the AI was not taking this into account when planning its cities.
       GNA#17745
     * Fix bug that could prevent the AI going for space race victory.
       GNA#17661
     * Fix bug that might cause the AI to use outdated information.
       GNA#17647
     * AI (and building advisor) was preparing defences against sea attack
       for rivers and irrigated land. GNAPATCH#2496

Help / Documentation

     * Include README.ruleset_multiplayer and README.ruleset_experimental
       in the distribution. GNA#17665
     * Remove spurious incorrect text about government effects on the
       chance of migration from help on governments. GNA#17919
     * Minor improvements to in-game text. GNA#17673 GNAPATCH#2550
       GNAPATCH#2578 GNAPATCH#2579 GNA#17803
     * Several invisible changes to assist with translation. GNAPATCH#2487
       GNA#17705 GNA#17809 GNA#17927

Translations

     * Updated translations:
          + Complete translations: Spanish, Catalan, French.
          + Incomplete translations: Polish (99.4%), Italian (75%),
            Ukrainian (67%), Irish Gaelic (56%).


CHANGES FROM 2.3.0-beta2 to 2.3.0-beta3
---------------------------------------

   (from <http://freeciv.wikia.com/wiki/NEWS-2.3.0-beta3>)

     * Fix distribution of manpage links in release tarball. This was
       causing compilation to fail consistently. GNA#17633
     * Documented in help text that cities in disorder can be represented
       either by a raised fist or a lightning bolt. GNA#17510
     * Corrected descriptions of experimental rulesets to say they belong
       to experimental, and not default, ruleset. GNAPATCH#2415
     * Get number of human players server has from metaserver. Gtk-client
       displays that information. GNAPATCH#2411
     * Brought Irish (ga) translation into use. GNAPATCH#2442
     * Updated terrain special graphics for Amplio2 tileset. GNA#16354
     * Fixed connectmsg command. GNA#17576

     * Updated translations: Catalan, Polish, Brazilian Portuguese


CHANGES FROM 2.3.0-beta1 to 2.3.0-beta2
---------------------------------------

   (from <http://freeciv.wikia.com/wiki/NEWS-2.3.0-beta2>)

Server / General

     * Fixed bug where happyborders did not work at all and base ownership
       was broken. GNA#17394
     * Bug fix: made global warming change terrain to warmer result, not
       cooler result. GNA#17447
     * Fixed player creation upon civil war. GNA#17391
     * Fix bug where a game saved while a civilization was in revolution
       would not save the target government correctly. GNA#17363
     * Fixed several bugs related to loading/saving scenarios. GNA#17158
       GNA#17381 GNA#17385 GNA#17508 GNA#17513 GNAPATCH#2340 GNA#17514
     * Fixed bug where citizens could become unavailable after city radius
       change. GNA#17377
     * Increased maximum citymindist value. GNAPATCH#2262
     * Fixed pathfinder to consider restrictinfra instead of assuming that
       unit can always benefit from roads. GNA#17380
     * Fixed minor bug where research goal could become invalid, causing
       error messages. GNA#17300
     * When a unit gains experience, mention which veterancy level has
       been reached in message log. GNAPATCH#1965
     * Fixed reporting of migration messages. GNA#17519
     * Inform the metaserver about number of human players, not including
       AI players. GNAPATCH#2312
     * Forbid meaningless negative values for the endturn option.
       GNA#17564
     * Fix for building with IPv6 support on OpenBSD. GNA#16458
     * Declare IPv6 support as no longer "work in progress". GNAPATCH#2282
     * Make "maintainer-clean" build target cleaner. GNA#16380
     * Windows: display meaningful message for winsock error #10060.
       GNA#16788
     * Server stability fixes. GNA#17415 GNA#17464 GNAPATCH#2344 GNA#17506
       GNA#17459 GNA#17557
     * Bootstrap/build fixes. GNA#17483 GNA#17488 GNA#16368 GNA#15410
     * Bug fixes and improvements to freeciv-manual application. GNA#17267
     * Improvements to freeciv-modpack application. GNA#16735 GNA#17004
       GNAPATCH#2309

Clients

     * Better handling of the situation where multiple Settlers are
       selected and the "Build city" order is issued. GNA#14702
     * Do not save gameseed or mapseed settings in client config file
       (this would cause the user to get the same game/map every time they
       started the client). GNA#17122
     * Improve handling of (non-default) rulesets which restrict
       reachability of technologies (via root_req in the ruleset) in the
       science report. You can now choose whether unreachable technologies
       are displayed. GNA#17537 GNAPATCH#2384 GNAPATCH#2385 GNA#16855
       GNAPATCH#2386
     * (GTK) In diplomacy dialog, remove current diplomatic status from
       list of allowed proposals. GNA#16557
     * (GTK) When in small screen mode, display the arrow indicating
       stacked units in sidebar. GNA#17456
     * (Xaw) Implemented take player functionality. GNAPATCH#2253
     * Avoid a potential client crash. GNA#17524

Gameplay / Rules

Supplied rulesets

     * The effects of notradesize / fulltradesize are now calculated
       separately from the normal corruption calculation; this gives a
       more consistent effect, and prevents building Courthouses to
       circumvent those settings. GNA#17348
     * Make the SaveSmallWonder flag actually have an effect; previously,
       all small wonders would be rebuilt if lost. This didn't matter for
       the default ruleset (where the Palace is the only "small wonder"
       and this effect is desired), but it does affect the new multiplayer
       ruleset. GNA#17333
     * Adjusted parameters for tech upkeep (enabled in the experimental
       ruleset). GNA#17270
     * Fixes specific to multiplayer ruleset:
          + Apollo Program wonder gave errors and did not work. GNA#17334
          + Fixed bug where wonders on one continent disabled buildings on
            others. GNA#17335
     * Allowed gameloss units to survive without home city even if
       killunhomed is enabled. GNA#17085
     * Fixes to nation rules. GNA#17556 GNAPATCH#2246
     * Minor improvements to supplied scenarios. GNAPATCH#2264
       GNAPATCH#2341

Other rulesets

     * gold_upkeep_style=2: when gold runs out, buildings and units are
       alternately sold (rather than selling all buildings before selling
       any units). GNA#16413

Help / Documentation

     * Improvements to in-game help and UI text. GNA#17246 GNA#17269
       GNA#17163 GNA#16884 GNA#17197 GNA#17168 GNA#17172 GNAPATCH#2301
       GNAPATCH#2355 GNA#17198 GNA#17302 GNA#17161 GNAPATCH#2240
     * Corrections to documentation. GNA#17336 GNAPATCH#2231 GNAPATCH#2326
       GNA#17484 GNA#17481
     * Minor improvements to comments in ruleset files. GNA#17428
     * Fix contact details in man pages. GNA#16922
     * Several invisible changes to assist with translation. GNAPATCH#2289
       GNAPATCH#2300 GNA#17422 GNA#17507 GNA#17509 GNA#17443 GNA#17444
       GNA#17504

Translations

     * Updated translations: Catalan, Polish, Spanish, Russian, Danish,
       French
