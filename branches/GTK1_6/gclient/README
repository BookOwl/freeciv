=== Friday, 19th June 1998

This is an early beta version of a FreeCiv client for GTK+.  It has been
done to work with freeciv-1.6.3.

It was coded by Vasco Costa <vasc@camoes.rnl.ist.utl.pt> in 3 long days of
late day & night hair pulling...  they said it couldn't be done and here it is!

It uses some main window designs by Ethan Fischer <allanon@u.washington.edu>.


=== Todo

	Design lots of dialogs: city dialog, trade dialog, etc.
	Handle diplomacy packets.
	Make tech trees.
	Serious code cleanups.
	Lots of other stuff i can't really remember right now.

Enjoy!
