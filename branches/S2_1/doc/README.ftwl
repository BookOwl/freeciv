Freeciv Theme and Widget Layer
==============================

Freeciv Theme and Widget Layer (FTWL) is a low-level library for 
manipulating the graphics and input systems on your computer,
and displaying screens with widgets based on themes loaded from 
configuration files.

Work on the FTWL library and client has stalled and is not working 
in this version. See later versions or the svn trunk version for
news, documentation and newer versions of this code.
