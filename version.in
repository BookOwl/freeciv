# Freeciv network capstring: see documentation in common/capstr.c
#
# "+2.1f" is the base capability string.
#
# "ReportFreezeFix" allows clients to correctly freeze reports and agents
#                   over turn change.
#
# "CF"              CursorFix makes sure that wait cursor is in use between
#                   turns and only between turns.
#
#
#   - No new manditory capabilities can be added to the release branch; doing
#     so would break network capability of supposedly "compatible" releases.
#
#   - Avoid adding a new manditory capability to the development branch for
#     as long as possible.  We want to maintain network compatibility with
#     the stable branch for as long as possible.
